(Love is injustice, but justice doesn’t suffice.)- Albert Camus

## INTRODUCTION

The rise of the strongmen in the international political arena came along with the wave of terror in the Philippines wherein the ebb and flow in the daily life of a Filipino consists of the dreadfully gripping atmosphere of fear due to the war on drugs campaigned by President Rodrigo Duterte which culminated to various condemnations locally by human rights organizations such as the Commission of Human Rights and international institutions such as the United Nations, among others.

The blissful campaign promise of President Rodrigo Duterte during the 2016 election season to get rid of criminality which he claims has festered the nation making it insecure for peace and stability thereby being a hindrance to change for the better good appealed to the masses which overwhelmingly threw their support to his candidacy, in effect electing him to be the President of the Philippines by a staggering amount of 16 million votes. President Duterte highlighted the vice-like grip of drug menace that has engulfed the nation, making its way into the lifestyle of every Filipino due to the consent or lack of political will of the local government officials making the state bow down to the wishes of the drug lords.[1]

In this regard, the President’s plan of action to eradicate crime was to wield an iron fist towards law enforcement, tapping the services of the Philippine National Police with the aid of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency in hunting down drug peddlers, drug users, or anyone connected with narco-trafficking, thus Oplan Double Barrel: Project Tokhang, the brainchild of President Duterte and Director General Ronald dela Rosa of the PNP unfolded itself on a nationwide scale, particularly targeting sections and municipalities that is mired with drug trafficking in urban Metro Manila, seeking to fulfill the election promise of Duterte to eliminate drugs nationwide in his first six months of office.

At the outset, the war on drugs was met with support by the public which reviled that the previous administration’s lack of political will only widened the gap between the rich and the poor and let criminality and poverty prosper in the streets. The actions by then Mayor Duterte of Davao which rid of drug trafficking enticed them to throw their support for the President in his plan since they were also the target of his grassroots campaign. It is evidenced even in recent local surveys such as the Social Weather Station that the popularity of Duterte locally is at a historic high, marking him at 83-percent popularity in the beginning of his term and war on drugs.[2] This was however met with harsh criticism by human rights groups that this may lead to police brutality and wrong enforcement of the law that would harm innocent people, bypassing the rule of law and thereby doing injustice in the long run.

The first one hundred days of President Duterte seems to be a good illustration of how the dilemma will unfold in the Philippines as the first wave of fear regarding extrajudicial killings or summary executions without the proper application of the rule of law starts to grip the nation. Due to the popular status of President Duterte, 700,000 Filipinos that has been connected with any drug-related activities surrendered themselves to the proper authorities which was not anticipated by the administration, resulting to overcrowded prisons, detention cells, and rehabilitation centers that is said to be inhumane.[3] Furthermore, police violence and extrajudicial killings is being criticized by various organizations such as Bayan Muna and put on the spotlight with more than 3,500 dead, half of which is due to summary executions done by vigilantes donning masks and escaping via motorcycles before crucifying/honoring the victim with a carton conveying that such victim is a drug addict and that he/she should not be emulated.[4]

Due to the immensity of the problem which the nation is engulfed in wherein it was discovered that drugs has truly proliferated into the daily lifestyle of the Filipino either by thru politics, as an example, it was discovered that the largest drug laboratory in the Philippines is held in the innocent and tiny island of Catanduanes allegedly owned and possessed by Governor Cua[5], or thru trafficking and usage in the communities which are largely impoverished, thus the ones largely affected and targeted by police brutality, President Duterte asked for an extension on Oplan Double Barrel: Project Tokhang.

Stinging criticism still continues to hound on the matter of police abuse in the war on drugs wherein it was deduced that it is mainly used by law enforcement agencies to extort money on people, so as not to implicate them as enemies of the State or not to endanger the lives. This is best exemplified by the tragic case of the South Korean national, Jee Ick-joo where it was determined during the investigation that he was kidnapped by authorities from the PNP and was threatened that he was involved in illegal drug trade and demanded a ransom of about eight million pesos and that he died due to strangulation inside Camp Crame and was later cremated in Caloocan and his remains flushed down the toilet.[6]

In order to ramp up the ante in the fight against criminality, the popular administration of Duterte is lobbying to the Congress to pass a law reinstating death penalty in the Philippines particularly on heinous crimes and drug-related offenses in order to fulfill the purpose of curbing criminality that is plaguing the country with the end purpose of fulfilling justice. As of writing, the deliberations in the House of Representatives has been final in the third and final reading wherein it was largely approved by the majority which states that House Bill No. 4727 reinstates death penalty only to drug-related offenses.

## ABOUT THE PAPER

The paper, entitled Hangyo, is sourced from the portmanteau word “Tokhang”, a name synonymous with terror and fear struck by the State’s own law enforcement agency due to its noted police brutality and blatant violation of human rights in its war against drugs. Project Tokhang sources it roots by combining the words “katok” (to knock) which is the known protocol for police investigations and operations in neighborhoods and communities mired with drug felons, and “hangyo” (to plead/pray) which is the common occurrence of victims of these investigation which normally seeks to spare their lives and freedom before the iron hand of the law.

“Hangyo: A Pleading For A Fragmented Nation” seeks to reflect introspectively and therefore pierce through the meta of the problem of death penalty bill in relation to the war on drugs, its constitutionality and its legal barriers both in the domestic and international landscape, the sociopolitical obstacles and ramifications it needs to acknowledge and recognize, and the moral crisis that is both confusing and further polarizing the already scattered and diverse standpoints of the ordinary Filipino who will at the end of the day be the victim of this sociological crucifixion done by the very institution that is mandated to protect them.

Just like any other prayer, this paper would only be a futile task if it does not resolve or produce constructive suggestions vis-à-vis with the problems presented wherein it interposes that if the bill should become a law be declared unconstitutional before the Supreme Court or by complying first with the duly established protocols on international obligations ratified by the State under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, either by undergoing the tedious process of withdrawing from the said treaty or instead by complying with it. Furthermore, it seeks to stress the advocacy of undergoing a massive reform in the criminal justice system by providing competent public defenders that will treat felonies with not only justice but also with compassion that will ultimately benefit the society, by synergizing the mandates and views of the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government towards restorative and social justice. Last but not the least, the paper calls on the hegemons of the Philippine society to influence and be a change in affecting unifying the various mindsets of the people so as not to cause further strife and polarization among varying cultures and economic class regarding their view towards death penalty.

## LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS

The passing of the House Bill No. 4727 in the third and final reading in the House of Representatives is already tarnished with procedural defects which is highlighted in Sec. 26, Art VI, of the 1987 Constitution, which provides that: “No bill passed by either House shall become a law unless it has passed 3 readings on separate days, and printed copies thereof in its final form have been distributed to its Members 3 days before its passage, except when the President certifies to the necessity of its immediate enactment to meet a public calamity or emergency.”[7] According to the solon who staunchly rejected the passing of the death penalty bill, Rep. Edcel Lagman, the passing of the bill transgressed the three-day notice rule and that printed and physical copies of the draft be presented before the lawmakers as provided by the Constitution.

On account of the three-day notice rule, absent the fact that there was no proclamation of the President that deems that the bill be expedited to meet a public calamity or emergency, the bill would have to be deemed unconstitutional since the House, in passing the second reading on the March 1 (Wednesday), and then docketing it for a final reading on March 7 (Tuesday), when it only conducts sessions on Mondays to Wednesdays does not fully comply with the complete three-day notice given to the House in order to review the furnished copy of the approved bill with amendments in the second reading[8], when it can be shown that the ripe time for the determination of the case must be on March 8 or onwards in order to comply with the principle laid down in the Constitution.

In this regard, the time allotted for a strict scrutiny of the proposed law by the lawmakers which has been duly elected by their constituents to represent them, of which the life of an individual hangs in the balance, is all the more reason to give more time and allowance for the solons to review the bill being deliberated upon. The expeditious scheduling of the third reading does not give ample time for analysis and criticism which may open the floodgates of unprecedented dire consequences and loopholes while consequently shutting off any possible suggestions or amendments which may not serve the ends of justice but instead inflict what is not being contemplated upon.

Conceding the fact that even if the three-day notice would be complied with, physical copies were not furnished to all the lawmakers, instead it was emailed on March 2 (Thursday)[9] when the Constitution requires that “printed copies thereof in its final form have been distributed to its Members 3 days before its passage”, indicative of the fact that the copies must be physical in nature since it is printed and not electronically communicated, therefore violating the mandate of the 1987 Constitution.

House Representative Edcel Lagman vowed to file a complaint before the Supreme Court to declare the unconstitutionality of the Death Penalty Law should it be reinstated due to the grounds cited above. Should the same happen, this would be a groundbreaking jurisprudence wherein the Court would be able to reconcile and rule upon the complex issue regarding the “enrolled bill doctrine” which categorically presumes that the attestation and the passing of the proposed law before the President effectively ends the lawmaking process and is not marred with defects, therefore making it a valid law[10], and the strict compliance with the lawmaking process, with subsequent rulings on judicial review regarding actual cases and controversies on whether when should lawmakers file a case when there has been a violation in the formulation and passage of a bill.

The issue regarding the constitutionality of the death penalty bill with regard to the procedural aspect in the House of Representatives is at all fours with the issue being presented in the case of Macias v. Commission on Elections. The petitioners argue that it does not show in the certificates of the Secretary of the House of Representatives that printed copies has been furnished to the solons three days before the passage of the bill in the Lower House. The respondents meanwhile interposed the enrolled bill doctrine that presumes that all bills passed in the Legislature has complied with the restrictions set forth by the Constitution and the House rules and thus free from any defects. The Court however decided not to determine the case on the basis of such issue and proceeded to analyze the case based on other grounds of constitutionality.[11] Should the case of Rep. Lagman prosper, it would be the illuminating jurisprudence with regard to the indefeasible enrolled bill doctrine and the passing of laws in the Legislature.

Notwithstanding the egregious violation of the fundamental law of the land in the passing of the death penalty bill, the State would have to undergo the tedious process of withdrawing from international obligations it owes due to the treaty it ratified, particularly the Second Optional Protocol of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which declares that the states that have ratified the treaty must commit themselves to abolish the death penalty within their own territory and jurisdiction with the reservation of retaining it during wartime following a conviction of a very serious crime of military nature.[12]

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is a multilateral treaty adopted by the United Nations General Assembly wherein the parties that has ratified such agreement would pledge to respect the civil and political rights of individuals within their own territory and jurisdiction. The ICCPR forms part of the basic tenets of international law that must be adhered to as it is part of the International Bill of Human Rights along with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Human Rights. The rights being enumerated in the treaty involve basic human rights such as the right to life, right to due process and fair trial, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of assembly. The Philippines has signed and ratified the ICCPR on the 23rd of October 1986 thereby recognizing the rights established by the treaty it entered upon.

But the more relevant discussion with regard to the Philippines’ dilemma is the Second Optional Protocol of the ICCPR which mandates that the signatories of the side agreement will abolish death penalties within their own jurisdiction save for some reservations for horrendous war crimes of military nature during wartime. The scenario of the Philippines depicts a classic struggle of sovereign might and self-determination against international compliance and codependence.

On the basis of technicality, the Philippines finds itself in a sui generis situation wherein it is bound to perform its duties and obligations as a signatory to the treaty. Due to a change in the political climate however, it is now on the verge of asserting its might by reinstating the death penalty averring that domestic law holds more weight and trumps international law. Ordinarily, treaties in which the State is bound can be repealed or withdrawn by the State in accordance with the proper procedure set by the Constitution, the treaty itself and other pertinent laws. In applying this concept, the Congress, would have to wield its might by simply voting with a majority regarding its withdrawal to the ICCPR as evidenced by Resolution No. 289 of the Senate which categorically states that “A treaty that is approved by the Senate becomes part of the law of the land, and any repeal of any treaty by a withdrawal should also require the concurrence of the Senate”.[13] This is however rebuffed by the Human Rights Committee declaring that the ICCPR is a sui generis treaty since it does not allow the withdrawal of any kind by the State that has already ratified the treaty[14], in light of the unilateral denunciations made by Jamaica and North Korea.

In reconciling the two conflicting statements and positions of both the State and the international community, it would be apt that the principle of sovereignty still be applied with the principle of incorporation as embedded in the Constitution which states that the State accepts the generally accepted principles of international law. Drawing comments from international legal luminaries, treaties are supposed to be deemed to have indefinite duration based on mutual agreement on the part of all the parties.[15] The presumption against the absence of an exit clause or withdrawal lies heavily against the parties which presumes that the treaty will be enforced indefinitely since it is deemed to promote a progressive development in international law, unless it unequivocally appears from the nature of the treaty it was to only have temporary application.[16]

Absent the fact that there is no exit or withdrawal clause in the ICCPR, the State may still withdraw from such treaty and exercise its might. However, such withdrawal may only be deemed effective and recognized when all of the parties in the multilateral treaty recognizes its withdrawal subject of course to legal effects wherein positively for the State, it is now precluded from assuming any responsibilities and obligations, but negatively wherein it must be held accountable for the acts it has done prior to the termination of the treaty, but in addition the State is also compelled with the duty to perform its duties and obligations that may be subject in another treaty or as a principle in customary international law. In any case, the Philippines is bound not only the ICCPR but customary international law as well wherein the abolition of death penalty can be assumed to be jus cogens since the ICCPR is ratified by most of the international community.

On a deeper analysis of the death penalty and its place on local and international law, staunch defenders of its reinstatement argues that the abolition of the death penalty paved the way for the proliferation of drug trafficking in the Philippines and that the ICCPR is a form of Western imperialism that greatly inhibits self-determination among Third World countries, particularly in tackling criminality that has wide economic and political implications, following the English School regarding foreign relations.[17] This type of perspective argues that the legalistic notion of drafting laws which dictates morals and good customs and the adoption of certain institutions and norms such as the United Nations and other organs are largely foreign and not apt to be applied in Asian states which cultures are not compatible to the mechanism that is being adhered to. In other words, the substantive soul of the nation is not congruent to the procedures being applied which must be the case in order for an institution to flourish, wherein the laws that permeate the consciousness of the society must equally reflect their ideals, aspirations, and values the State holds dear.[18] In such case that the law is not compatible with the institution, the society will in turn fail.

To elucidate further, the introduction of human rights is deemed to be mainly foreign to Asian states wherein cultural diversity plays a crucial role during the formulation of the Universal Bill of Rights due to the notable difference of government and institutions that plays a role in the society.[19] A concise comparative historical analysis is required in order to grasp the difference between the two continental philosophies regarding human rights. A.J.N. Milne’s Human Rights and Human Diversity perfectly summarizes the East-West cultural diversity conflict.[20]

Legalism made its way to the consciousness of the Western ideal when the plethora of conflicts that ensued in Europe saw the (d)evolution of the beliefs of people gone from God who is represented by the monarchy, then to the State, then focusing on individual rights of the people, signifying the importance of the might of the people through the codification of their values, aspirations, and rights, which led to the liberalization of the individual instead of blind adherence to institutions which does not safeguard their freedom.[21] These can be concretized during the multilateral treaties and accords that were established after the Peace of Westphalia which was a religious war waged between kingdoms and states and the codification of the Magna Carta during the reign of King John of England which restrained the sovereign of his unlimited rule over his constituents, thus giving them rights which must be upheld and cherished for the self-preservation of the State/Kingdom. Laws thus became of primary importance as a source of morals, established behavior, and rights which must be respected in the Western world, marking the genesis of the idea of basic human rights wherein the established notion is that in order for the gears of the State to completely function, it must first respect the rights of its citizens, depicting the social contract theory of the French thinker Jean Jacques Rosseau. Individual and right is might.

The mindset of the East however is different from its Western counterpart in such a way that the individual mainly conforms to the dictates of the society, which is largely dominated by religion and tradition, even finding its influence seeping in the government itself. Eastern states has complete autonomy and rule over its people that it does not recognize much of their human rights as it is understood that the State has primacy importance over the individual. A historical illustration that would aptly depict the development of the ideology in the Eastern governance may be that of the Bolshevik Revolution which saw the uprising of the proletariat class against the bourgeoisie, marking the importance of the community and obligation comes before individual and right, sharing characteristics with African and Chinese doctrine and philosophy which hinges on the significance of society over man.[22] While the Western philosophy highlights the importance of the spokes and the hubs (man) for the continuous movement of the wheel (State), Eastern philosophy rests upon the premise that the State being the primary contributor or provider of basic human needs must be preserved and has much importance over the individual. A very stark difference of human rights between the two philosophies is undeniably clear.

It is in this perspective that proponents of cultural diversity argue that the ICCPR tramples upon the principle of self-determination of States and therefore restricts its power in the formulation of laws that would enable it to curb criminality that would ensure the safety of its citizens and therefore attract lucrative investments and businesses that would revitalize its economy thereby making social services available and the general welfare of the people ensured. A judicious interpretation must however be tried wherein the two differing views may be reconciled and that the installment of ICCPR does not in any way inhibit the principle of sovereignty.

A synthesis between the two varying concepts of human rights as explained in the East-West conflict may be said that the ICCPR has the noble obligation of ensuring the existence of the State, should the State fail in preserving its own. Since the State will not exist without its own people, the international community has the duty of intervening in situations where it is deemed crucial when the existence of a State is at stake. The installation of the ICCPR serves as an instrument that will guide the signatories on how they should treat their own citizens, without any intervention of any external actors and with still respect to their national laws in such a way that the Human Right Committee, the monitoring commission tasked to monitor compliance with the treaty, will only act if all domestic means have been exhausted by the oppressed individual or society.

In such a case, the ICCPR acts a measure of both the State and individual on how to preserve itself by preventing the former from gravely abusing its power upon its own citizens so as to appease them and not to incite them to revolt that would endanger its very own existence, and by granting the latter avenues on how to assert its individual rights in the hands of tyrannical State. The ICCPR acts as a passive humanitarian intervention that would prevent the transgression of the principle of non-intervention by force since it is done with the consent of the State wherein it is free to adopt any kinds and types of mechanism that would still ensure that justice at the end of the day is served to the people, locally and internationally.

## SOCIOPOLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS

The question of death penalty not only revolves around its constitutionality but also on its sociopolitical ramifications toward the society. The adoption of such a gruesome method begs the question on whether it is feasible, beneficial, or even necessary. For one, the State has to acknowledge that first and foremost, the criminal justice system is deeply flawed. Critical factors ranges from the straying away from the veering trend of the application of criminal justice that hinges towards rehabilitation and reformation instead of being retributive and punitive, that in the end only results to further strife and detriment of the State instead of social justice; lack of State resources such as manpower with regard to public defenders, facilities and technology that would provide effectiveness and efficiency thus resulting to cost savings that could be better reallocated to rehabilitation subject to compliance with international standards and regulation for the humane treatment of detention prisoners, and courts that would streamline the speedy determination of cases; and the possible revamp of law enforcement in the Philippines that would be less oppressive against the impoverished and marginalized which will only polarize and create friction within classes.

The Revised Penal Code of the Philippines which took effect on 1930 is forged on the foundations of the classicist school which is premised on the idea that the punishment must equal the crime committed since it was done solely with the consent and intelligence of the felon. In other words, the purpose of the classicist school is to be retributive and punitive. The changing times however proves that the commission of a crime transcends the felony and the criminal itself but also extends itself to the factors of environment such as poverty, marginalization, and the likes which is partly the fault of the State. In this regard, the approach of contemporary criminal justice towards such felonies is through rehabilitation and reformation wherein the State recognizes that the commission of the crime is not done solely by the intelligence and will of the individual but is also influenced by external factors such as the environment and that his reintegration and curing of his social illness will be much more beneficial and productive to the State by the earning of taxes and labor instead of mere reliance towards his preservation inside the detention facility.

To adapt to the changing sway of the modern times and basing the foundation of this argument on the Positivist School, the State must resort to other forms of methods or adopt policies that will ensure a criminal justice that is bereft of corruption and deficiencies should the formulation and application of such will not be perfect so that social justice that will reform prisoners and felons be more beneficial to the State in the long term.

A suggestion in this sense would be the repeal of the antiquated Revised Penal Code and a formulation of a new criminal statute that is centered on the rehabilitation and reformation of convicts. Heralded as one of the Philippine Legislature’s admirable formulation of a law, its history is one of the very reasons that it must be repealed due to its rigidity and inflexibility to the passage of time which does not remain constant. The history of the Revised Penal Code traces its roots from the American period where it was merely the consolidation of all the existing penal laws existing during those times, even more horrifying is that even most of the penal codes which have been literally copied dates back to the Spanish era and has not been amended or repealed during the American period, although legal historians argue that the situation is much more grave as the Spanish Penal Code was heavily influenced by French Penal Code of 1810, and thus was the real mother of the 1930 Revised Penal Code. The journal article of Christine Lao sheds an immense light regarding this matter.[23]

To summarize the flaws of the Revised Penal Code in Lao’s article, the penal statute fails to adapt to the changing times wherein sexual and religious discrimination, the non-adjustment of the fines due to inflation that is now obsolete and does not pose a heavier punishment that would be exemplary for the convict and others so that may not commit the felony which proves to be only detrimental to the State itself since the fine that is stated is not commensurate with the manpower, facilities, and resources exhausted to keep public order, and the continued perpetration of violence and crime due to the prison system, creating a culture of delinquency that prolongs and makes more harsh the cycle of violence, which is not the ultimate end of justice.[24]

Certain enactments have been made that is reflective of the Positivist School that steadfastly eschews the advocacy of reformation such as the Indeterminate Sentence Law, Juvenile Delinquency Law, Parole Law, and other amendments to felonies.[25] We must however welcome the drafting of new laws that would promote wholesome reformation and rehabilitation of convicts and prisoners that would enable them to be productive members of society, producing income for the State through legal means and effecting positive change within the society, perpetuating instead a cycle of justice. Data culled from the most the Department of Justice shows that an astounding 1,004 recidivists were again readmitted in 2010 and that alarming rates has spiked up regarding readmission to the penal institution due to conviction of a different crime wherein it has steadily increased from 4% in 2004 to 19% in 2010 which costs the State more or less 1.5 billion pesos for operational expenses of its prison facilities.[26]

Anent the issue of reforms in the criminal justice system, the dire need of improvement and increase of manpower in the Public Attorney’s Office and the Office of the Solicitor General could not be any more highlighted. Being the ones tasked with the prosecution and defense of the accused and complainants before the court, they are instrumental in meting out justice to the fullest extent. However, due to shortage of manpower in their offices, the public defenders are hounded with clogged dockets that bewilders the facility of the human intellect. At the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) which has a measly annual budget of 825,121,000 million pesos, the average number of clients assisted by each PAO lawyer numbers to around 3,420 not including the actual cases he is handling which involves the preparation of pleadings, motions, and all other pertinent court activities which amounts to about 452 cases.[27] In correlation, the number of cases handled by PAO totaled to about 632,524 cases of which 148,467 are only disposed of by the courts that renders the accused either acquitted or temporarily released, but all the more suggesting that the wheels of justice, when compromised, moves slowly.

Although the National Prosecution Service has been dubbed to be revamped and increased in budget, there seems to be little improvement in the department where it can be shown that each prosecutor handles over 510 cases annually notwithstanding the investigation workload he/she must cover which is essential which amounts to 183 and only has a low rate of disposition barely hitting the 75% percentile wherein out of the 340,000 cases only 255, 000 are resolved. Putting together the equipment that is not suited for the task at hand with the Sisyphean task ahead with only a measly amount of salary being offered, the tasks of the public defenders are almost usually compromised wherein they usually advice their clients to just plead guilty in order to speed up their cases and have a minimum sentence spent in the penitentiary.[28]

The lack of manpower, budget, facilities, appropriate mandatory continuing legal education, and equipment on the part of the public defenders results to the ultimate kind of injustice to the State wherein it shells out funds only to stop the gap from spilling which will only open the floodgates to more expenses in order to accommodate more delinquents and felons in the penitentiary which is already clogged. If the State were to focus on the improvement on these particular types of justice departments primarily, and make them focus on helping and cooperating with the accused, recognizing the principle of the Positivist school and its tenets, they may be able to transform and build the society from the ground up. For all we know, a juvenile drug felon may be a future productive member of the society but only resorted to illegal means in order to cope up with the harsh realities of life.

Secondly, the State must focus on the reformation of the national penitentiary system wherein it has been condemned for being too inhumane in treating detention prisoners which has ballooned over the past few months due to the war on drugs by the present administration. The United Nations Human Rights Committee mandates that detention facilities be sufficiently humane for the prisoners or otherwise it would be transgressing basic human rights. It also advocates for the education of the prisoners so they would turn to productive citizens and would be able to cope with the society once out of the penal institution.[29] However, facts collated from various news clipping show that the facilities meant for prisoners are way below the standards prescribed by the Commission mainly because of the recent war on drugs which has already caused the rapid increase of overpopulation on an overpopulated prison facility. The Quezon City Jail which is only built for 800 inmates now houses 4,400 with the prisoners cramped when asleep, likening the inhumane conditions of the Africans being transported to America during the slave trade during the 18th century.

Data culled from the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology shows that the congestion rate of the prison facilities spiked alarmingly high with Region III having 946% increase in congestion which is the highest while the National Capital Region has an increase of almost 547% amounting to almost 31, 043 inmates committed inside the prison facilities wherein the average annual budget of 1.5 billion pesos is starting to succumb to the sheer amount of felons inside, thus having a sub-standard lifestyle, food, and services to the inmates which only broods violence and in the end only forments recidivism, thereby curtailing the goal of social justice in criminal law.[30]

The slow administration of appointments in the courts has also been cited as one of the reasons why the wheels of justice are slow in the determination and disposition of cases. The Supreme Court has determined in one case that the imposition of death penalty and the determination of the lower courts regarding its application resulted to a ghastly error of 71.77%.[31] The lives that has gone erroneously to the electric chair, rope, or the lethal injection is unfathomable. This can traced to be the result of the various failures of the different departments that is connected with the implementation of criminal justice. In a nutshell, before even the Courts have the right to send a man to the gallows, the mechanism and procedure which it must implement and use must be first perfect and seamless so as to guarantee that justice is indeed done. Otherwise, it would be the ultimate hypocrisy, that the Court who interprets the law, the final bastion of rights and justice, committed a flagrant and despicable act of injustice.

Finally, the ultimate and the significant argument regarding the imposition of death penalty revolves around the concept of social justice. Would death penalty, in the end, do justice? Would retributive justice succeed against the drug war? Would this violent method prevail? Accounts from nations and presidents of past administrations of states that is mired with narcopolitics says otherwise. The most notable of which is the plea in the New York Times of President Cesar Gaviria[32], the former president of Colombia who is personally involved with the war on drugs and is credited with the capture of the most famous drug lord in the world, Pablo Escobar. In his article, Gaviria articulated that while he may have won by capturing Pablo Escobar, it was a Pyrrhic victory since it came at a tremendous prize wherein not only judges, journalists, and notable figures were assassinated but innocent people were involved in the bloodshed on the hunt for the elusive drug lord. The coffers of the government has been spent on law enforcement instead of being allocated to public health and safety, education, crackdown on money laundering operation by narcos and investing in sustainable development for the people so as not to stray away to drugs. The aggressive approach against the war on drugs, militarization only adds oil to the flame as the illegal operations will only spread to other parts of the country or neighboring countries.

By injecting the economy to education and health, the government of Colombia was able to in the end win the war on drugs by achieving social justice. Through the promotion of education which in the long term guide the youth and equips them with the proper tools and mindset to compete in the globalized world, and investing in sustainable development for communities, they are able to stray away the community festered with drug abuse and turn them instead to productive citizens. In the end, the feasibility of the project is hopeful and there were no rights that were infringed upon by the State, thus achieving a cycle of social justice that terminated or halted the progress of drug trafficking in Colombia. This model is also implemented by various Western countries particularly plagued with the drug trade especially Spain and Portugal. Other countries are following suit to this particular type of policy.[33]

Other approaches regarding the drug problem may also be applied by the government although it has outrightly refused to review the reports in the past, it serves as an enlightening guide on how to tackle properly the drug menace. The report of the Global Commission on Drug Policy highlights the failure of the prohibition of drugs and in turn highlights the advantages of a partial decriminalization of various drugs that could in turn be socioeconomically beneficial to the State.[34] It highlights the treatment of Portugal to drug users wherein instead of immediately prosecuting them or incarcerating, they instead turn the person to a commission known as “dissuasion commissions” (CDT) that would determine if the person needs assistance in addressing his drug usage. Instead of automatically linking the usage of drugs to criminality, the user was instead holistically treated and not besmirched as a criminal since such usage may stem from other factors entirely foreign to criminality which may be mental illness, poverty, or health issues. Since then, Portugal has seen a rapid drop in criminality concretized by the large reduction drug-related killings, a positive outcome in the health sector where the rate of infection of AIDS has tremendously reduced, and economic progress due to health sector investments.

Applying this practice to the Philippine context should be however approached with caution as decriminalization and authentication of business to sell drugs may only increase the legal revenues earned by drug lords. In this case, only the treatment of drug users should be approached in a different manner by the law enforcement agencies. Absent the fact that such person is a drug peddler or trafficker, the one caught in possession of the drugs must be treated holistically and in the end be treated not as a criminal but as a person.

## RESPONSOBILITIES OF THE HEGEMON AND OF THE PEOPLE

As a final plea, in recognizing the diversity of the Philippine culture, the society must enjoin the State from carrying out the death penalty bill by relying on the hegemons that carries heavy influence among the Filipinos. First and foremost, the victims of the war on drugs must speak out and protest, which are largely the poor. Almost all of the 7,000 victims of police brutality are targeted against the impoverished sector largely deprived of public service and goods, and living in the slums.[35] The bulwark of the Philippine society consists of the poor who are the victims against the war on drugs. They must be encouraged to denounce and cry foul over the policy of the State in carrying out Oplan Tokhang through peaceful means as prescribed in the Constitution.

Likewise, religious institutions such as the Catholic Church, Islam, and Iglesia ni Cristo which are bastions of faith that eschews the importance and significance of life must take part in political activities that would engage its communities and followers to urge the State in the preservation of the right to life. In turn, academic institutions which are the most receptive to ideas and discourse must also engage on the political platform in order to enlighten people regarding the effects of the reinstatement of the death penalty law on their cities, communities, and families, all the more important are those academic institutions which are elite and must campaign on the grassroots. The society must educate and enlighten itself through political discourse wherein hopefully an intellectual revolution will take place that would be more beneficial for a formulation of a new system that would instead focus on social justice.

## CONCLUSION

Applying justice in the strictest and retributive manner would only result to further corruption, curtailing the long-term goals of State in ensuring the welfare of the citizens since justice in this sense will not suffice. Justice should be seen as wholesome and compassionate that would unite the people and not sow discord. The ultimate act of justice is that it be treated with charity that sees all the fragments of the story and not only justice that condemns and seek retribution for what separates justice and justice with charity is the nailing of the Man/God on the chair/cross.
